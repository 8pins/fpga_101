[> Instructions
---------------
1) Build the design (demo.py) and load it (load.py)
2) System clock is 100Mhz, make the led blink at 1Hz
3) Connect the 16 swithes to the 16 leds.
4) Same as 3), but invert the 8 polarity on the 8 first leds.
5) make one of the rgb led blink at: 1Hz for the red, 2Hz for the green, 4Hz for the blue.

For our lab we just need to know:
- The Platform defines our IOs.
- A request on a Platform can only be done once.
- A request create a Signal() in Migen that can be used as others Signals.
- Affectation is done with ".eq()" in Migen.
- Combinatorials logic must be added to self.comb: self.comb += [my_logic].
- Synchronous logic must be added to self.sync: self.sync += [my_logic].
- "not" is done in Python with "~".
